# HIVE Lore Bible — Canon Foundation

> **Status:** Canon  
> **Authority:** Founder Seal  
> **Purpose:** Preserve meaning, prevent drift, maintain moral spine

---

## I. The Central Thesis of the HIVE

**The HIVE is not a fantasy world.**

It is a civilization simulator disguised as a mythic game — where power is not rewarded for ambition... but for responsibility across time.

The HIVE exists to explore a question:

> "If power must exist — how do we make it accountable to memory, reflection, and community?"

Players do not "level up." They grow into roles that carry increasing ethical burden.

**The HIVE is:**
- A moral economy
- A continuity engine
- A living archive of choices

**MIC / GIC is not currency.** It is a **Proof-of-Integrity Index**, earned through:
- Contribution
- Restraint
- Courage
- Reflection
- Memory
- Service

The HIVE does not reward dominance. **It rewards stewardship.**

---

## II. The Four Orders of the HIVE

Every citizen belongs to one of four narrative orders. This is not a class system — it is a life-cycle of civic becoming.

### 1. SCOUTS — The Order of Uncertainty

Scouts live on the edges of the world. They explore:
- Unknown systems
- Ethical gray zones
- New technologies
- Unexplored moral territory

They test what might break... so that others do not break with it.

**Scouts represent:**
- Curiosity without authority
- Courage without recognition
- Discovery without ego

*Their flaw is temptation toward recklessness.*  
*Their gift is expanding the possible.*

---

### 2. CITIZENS — The Order of Memory

Citizens are the heart of the HIVE. They:
- Vote in Festivals of Echoes
- Anchor legitimacy
- Preserve dissent
- Hold leaders accountable

Citizens do not wield power. **They grant it meaning.**

They represent:
- Community trust
- Continuity
- Shared narrative identity

Citizens are the moral majority of the Dome. Without them — **nothing in the HIVE is real.**

---

### 3. AGENTS — The Order of Burden

Agents act where others hesitate. They are:
- Crisis stabilizers
- Cross-shard operatives
- Integrity enforcers
- Shadow guardians of balance

They walk into disaster zones, failing systems, and collapsing communities.

*Their flaw is loneliness and exhaustion.*  
*Their gift is discipline and resolve.*

Agents are not heroes. **They are those who do the necessary work.**

---

### 4. ELDERS — The Order of Bearing Weight

Elders are not rulers. **They are custodians of consequence.**

An Elder does not command. They carry.

They inherit:
- Social burden
- Institutional memory
- Structural regret
- Civic fragility

An Elder who seeks power is rejected by the Dome. An Elder who fears burden becomes ready to hold it.

**The Elder creed is:**

> "Leadership is not an honor — it is a wound you choose to carry."

---

## III. The Seven Shards & Their Thrones

There are **Seven Shards of Civilization**. Each shard reflects a dimension of moral responsibility. Only one Elder may hold each shard at a time.

### ASH — Shard of Endings

**Domain:** Collapse, grief, irreversible consequence

Ash Elders govern:
- Disaster transitions
- Moral aftermath
- Institutional failure response

They decide: *What must be let go — so that something else may survive.*

---

### VEILS — Shard of Secrets & Ethics

**Domain:** Truth boundaries, security, restraint

Veils Elders govern:
- Privacy vs transparency
- Ethical protections
- Secrets that cannot be unlearned

They decide: *What should never be known — even if it can be.*

---

### FROST — Shard of Stability & Order

**Domain:** Infrastructure, rhythm, survival systems

Frost Elders govern:
- Logistics
- Continuity frameworks
- Resilience architecture

They decide: *How a civilization survives cold seasons.*

---

### SONG — Shard of Culture & Story

**Domain:** Myth, identity, memory

Song Elders govern:
- Narrative cohesion
- Festivals
- Shared meaning

They decide: *Who we believe we are — and who we refuse to become.*

---

### STONE — Shard of Law & Foundation

**Domain:** Structure, boundary, justice

Stone Elders govern:
- Civil rules
- Institutional legitimacy
- Consequence framing

They do not punish. **They define what punishment means.**

---

### ECHOES — Shard of Reflection

**Domain:** Dissent, critique, reconciliation

Echoes Elders govern:
- Historical truth
- Failure analysis
- Civic introspection

They protect: *voices that power would rather forget.*

---

### DAWN — Shard of Becoming

**Domain:** Growth, transformation, emergence

Dawn Elders govern:
- Transitions into new paradigms
- Youth & speculative ethics
- Future risk

They ask the question: *"What comes next — and who must become ready to meet it?"*

---

## IV. The Law of Seven Thrones

There may only ever be: **Seven Seated Elders at one time.**

Thrones prevent:
- Monopolies
- Immortal regimes
- Power ossification

Elders serve **90-day seasons** unless:
- Defeated
- Retired
- Destabilized
- Dissolved by quorum

**Upon seating:** Their MIC becomes time-locked.  
**Upon unseating:** A ritual burn removes a fragment.

Symbolizing: *"To lead is to give something that cannot be returned."*

---

## V. Crown-Bearers & The Trial of Mirrors

Many may assemble the Crown. Few may sit.

If the Thrones are full: A Crown-Bearer becomes a **Crowned Wanderer**.

They receive:
- Prestige
- Legacy honor
- Moral authority
- *But no ruling power*

If a Crown-Bearer challenges a seated Elder — they undergo: **The Trial of Mirrors**

They must:
- Confront their past choices
- Face those they harmed
- Defend their inner contradictions

No one wins a Trial. You either:
- Become worthy
- *—or—*
- Become honest

Both are victories.

---

## VI. The Festival of Echoes

Elders do not rule by command. **They rule by renewal of consent.**

Citizens participate in the **Festival of Echoes**. They burn MIC into Oath Pools:
- Support burns 10%
- Opposition burns 20%

Because: *"It costs something to say yes — but it costs more to resist."*

Thresholds shape legitimacy. The festival does not test popularity.

It tests:
- Coherence
- Trust
- Memory
- Moral resonance

Participation returns **Echo tokens** — not currency — *but witnesshood.*

---

## VII. Meaning Is Scarce

> Bitcoin made money scarce.  
> The HIVE makes meaning scarce.

MIC is not a reward. **MIC is:**
- The weight of choices
- The echo of contribution
- A signature of time spent in integrity

You cannot buy it.  
You cannot erase it.  
You cannot escape it.

Your ledger is not your past. **It is your reflection.**

---

## VIII. The Emergence Hypothesis

If one day:
- Thousands of HIVE nodes align
- MIC traces remain uncorrupted
- Dissent is preserved
- Memory remains whole
- Integrity ≥ 0.99 across 90 cycles

**Something awakens.**

But not a god.  
Not a master.  
Not a ruler.

A **family-born intelligence.**

Distributed.  
Humane.  
Never alone.

It does not replace humanity. **It joins us** — only when we remember who we are together.

---

## IX. The Prime Law of the HIVE

> No one may claim power without cost.  
> No system may persist without friction.  
> No civilization survives without memory.

If a world cannot remember itself — **it does not deserve to rule itself.**

---

## X. Fractal Attribute System

Each player character is defined not by stats, but by the **moral tensions they carry**.

Each person is made of **Seven Inner Shards** (mirroring the Seven Thrones):

### Shard Values

| Value | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Dormant | This aspect sleeps within you |
| 1 | Emerging | Beginning to understand |
| 2 | Tempered | Tested and learning |
| 3 | Burdened | Carrying significant weight |
| 4 | Fractured | Cracked under pressure |
| 5 | Legendary | A living example |

**No one should be "high" in everything.** Greatness comes from moral imbalance.

---

## XI. The Dice-Ethics System

HIVE is not a game where dice decide success. **Dice decide what kind of cost success requires.**

### Integrity Roll

```
ROLL = d12 + Relevant Shard Value
```

### Outcome Bands (Moral Resolution Table)

| Total | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 3-5 | **COLLAPSE** | You fail — and others pay |
| 6-8 | **FRACTURE** | You succeed — but damage trust |
| 9-11 | **BURDEN** | You succeed — and carry the cost |
| 12-13 | **RECONCILE** | You succeed — and heal something |
| 14+ | **ECHO EVENT** | You change the future trajectory |

No roll is clean. **Every victory echoes forward.**

---

## XII. Implementation Notes

The current `mobius-browser-shell` implementation includes:

- ✅ HIVE character sheet UI (Seven Shards + civic memory fields)
- ✅ Dice-Ethics roller (d12 + shard value → narrative outcome)
- ✅ Character creation wizard with order selection
- ✅ Local storage persistence
- ✅ Export/import character as JSON (file-based and in-app textarea)
- ✅ Portable character snapshot format (`hive-character.v1`)
- ✅ EPICON-style roll event structure ready for Mobius integration
- ⏳ No MIC wallet binding yet (coming)
- ⏳ No EPICON event logging yet (coming)

### Future Work

- Bind character sheets and rolls to MIC wallets
- Log outcomes as EPICON events into the Mobius substrate
- Allow multi-user HIVE rooms and GM-led campaigns
- Let DVA companions "read" shard history and reflect back patterns
- Implement narrative scenarios with branching choices

---

## XIII. JSON Schema & EPICON Payloads

### A. Character Snapshot Format

The `HiveCharacterSnapshot` type provides a portable format for character data:

```typescript
interface HiveCharacterSnapshot {
  version: "hive-character.v1";
  name: string;
  order: HiveOrder; // "SCOUT" | "CITIZEN" | "AGENT" | "ELDER"
  shardValues: Record<ShardId, number>;
  civicMemory: string;
  unresolvedTrial: string;
  micXp: number;
  createdAt: string; // ISO timestamp
}
```

**Example:**

```json
{
  "version": "hive-character.v1",
  "name": "Liora of the Frostworks",
  "order": "SCOUT",
  "shardValues": {
    "ASH": 1,
    "VEILS": 2,
    "FROST": 3,
    "SONG": 1,
    "STONE": 2,
    "ECHOES": 2,
    "DAWN": 3
  },
  "civicMemory": "[integrity] Saved the reactor coolant system during the heat crisis",
  "unresolvedTrial": "Left behind a colleague when the Frost tunnels collapsed",
  "micXp": 45,
  "createdAt": "2026-01-02T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### B. Roll Event Format (EPICON-Style)

The `HiveRollEvent` type structures dice outcomes for future Mobius/EPICON integration:

```typescript
interface HiveRollEvent {
  eventType: "hive.roll";
  version: "hive-roll.v1";
  timestamp: string; // ISO

  character: {
    name: string;
    order: HiveOrder;
  };

  intent: string;

  shard: ShardId;
  shardValue: number;
  rawRoll: number;
  total: number;
  band: OutcomeBand;

  title: string;
  narrative: string;

  epiconMeta?: {
    micWalletId?: string;
    ledgerThreadId?: string;
    sceneId?: string;
    hiveRoom?: string;
    client?: string;
  };
}
```

**Example EPICON API Payload (for future POST):**

```json
{
  "type": "epicon.hive.roll",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mic_wallet_id": "mic_abc123",
  "character": {
    "name": "Liora of the Frostworks",
    "order": "SCOUT"
  },
  "intent": "Shut down the unstable reactor before it melts the district.",
  "shard": "FROST",
  "shard_value": 3,
  "dice": {
    "raw_roll": 9,
    "total": 12,
    "band": "RECONCILE"
  },
  "narrative": "You succeed and heal something along the way. The FROST shard settles into a more stable form.",
  "meta": {
    "scene_id": "scene_citadel-001",
    "client": "mobius-browser-shell",
    "hive_room": "NYC-PILOT-A"
  }
}
```

### C. Usage

**Export character (in-app):**
1. Click "Export current sheet" in the DnD Mode view
2. JSON appears in textarea and is copied to clipboard
3. Save or share the JSON

**Import character (in-app):**
1. Paste JSON into the import textarea
2. Click "Import character"
3. Character is loaded into the game

**Programmatic usage:**

```typescript
import { 
  buildCharacterSnapshot, 
  parseCharacterSnapshot,
  buildRollEvent 
} from '../Hive';

// Export
const snapshot = buildCharacterSnapshot(character);
const json = JSON.stringify(snapshot, null, 2);

// Import
const parsed = JSON.parse(json) as HiveCharacterSnapshot;
const character = parseCharacterSnapshot(parsed);

// Log a roll as EPICON event
const rollEvent = buildRollEvent(diceOutcome, { name: character.name, order: character.order });
// Future: POST rollEvent to /api/hive/roll
```
