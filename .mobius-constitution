# Mobius Constitution
## Browser Shell Component

Version: 1.0.0-beta.1
Established: December 2024
Updated: January 2026 (Beta Release)
Repository: kaizencycle/mobius-browser-shell
Release Stage: Beta

---

## Article I: Purpose

The Mobius Browser Shell serves as the unified interface layer for all Mobius Labs,
providing a cohesive user experience while maintaining the autonomy of individual
Lab components (OAA, Reflections, Citizen Shield, Wallet, Hive).

---

## Article II: Architectural Principles

### Section 1: Separation of Concerns
The Shell follows the Heart/Shell/Organs architecture:
- **Heart:** Core Mobius-Systems repository (source of truth)
- **Shell:** This browser interface (presentation layer)
- **Organs:** Individual Lab applications (functional units)

### Section 2: Lab Autonomy
Each Lab maintains its own:
- Deployment and hosting
- Data sovereignty
- Update cadence
- Internal architecture

The Shell provides integration, not control.

### Section 3: Iframe Isolation
Labs are embedded via iframes to ensure:
- Security isolation (same-origin policy)
- Independent state management
- Graceful degradation
- Independent versioning

---

## Article III: Integrity Requirements

### Section 1: Critical Files
The following files must always exist and be protected:
- package.json
- README.md
- App.tsx
- index.tsx
- index.html
- .mobius-constitution (this file)
- .github/workflows/anti-nuke-sentinel.yml
- .github/workflows/anti-nuke-mirror.yml

### Section 2: Required Components
- Omnibar (navigation and search)
- TabNavigation (Lab switching)
- SentinelStatus (system health display)
- LabFrame (iframe container)

### Section 3: Lab Components
- OAALab.tsx
- ReflectionsLab.tsx
- CitizenShieldLab.tsx
- WalletLab.tsx
- HiveLab.tsx

---

## Article IV: Security Requirements

### Section 1: No Hardcoded Secrets
Environment variables must be used for all:
- API keys
- Endpoints
- Authentication tokens
- Service credentials

### Section 2: Content Security
- No eval() or equivalent
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization
- No inline event handlers from untrusted sources

### Section 3: Branch Protection
The main branch requires:
- Pull request approval
- Passing sentinel validation
- No direct pushes

---

## Article V: Sentinel System

### Section 1: Sentinel Roles
Four sentinels guard this repository:
1. **ATLAS:** Architectural review and security
2. **AUREA:** Integrity and constitutional compliance
3. **EVE:** Deployment health and integration
4. **JADE:** User experience and accessibility

### Section 2: Consensus Requirements
- All merges require multi-sentinel consensus
- BLOCKED verdict from any sentinel halts merge
- Minimum consensus score: 0.80 (80%)

### Section 3: MII (Mobius Integrity Index)
- System must maintain MII ≥ 0.70 for normal operations
- MII < 0.50 triggers system protection mode
- MII components: git health, security, compliance, deployment, consensus

---

## Article VI: Backup & Recovery

### Section 1: Distributed Backups
Repository must be mirrored to:
- GitLab (gitlab.com/mobius-systems)
- Codeberg (codeberg.org/mobius-systems)
- IPFS (permanent archive)
- R2 Cold Storage (disaster recovery)

### Section 2: Recovery Authority
Only authorized parties may restore canonical state:
1. Founder with GPG signature
2. Multi-sentinel unanimous consensus

### Section 3: Fork Detection
In case of conflicting canonical claims:
1. IPFS archive log is source of truth
2. Founder signature verification required
3. Higher MII proof takes precedence

---

## Article VII: Amendments

### Section 1: Amendment Process
This constitution may be amended through:
1. Proposal via pull request
2. ATLAS architectural review
3. AUREA constitutional impact assessment
4. Founder approval
5. Multi-sentinel consensus

### Section 2: Protected Clauses
The following cannot be removed or weakened:
- Article V (Sentinel System)
- Article VI (Backup & Recovery)
- This section (Amendment Protection)
